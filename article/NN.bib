We demonstrate that {CAM}-B3LYP yields atomization energies of similar quality to those from B3LYP, while also performing well for charge transfer excitations in a dipeptide model, which B3LYP underestimates enormously. The {CAM}-B3LYP functional comprises of 0.19 Hartree–Fock ({HF}) plus 0.81 Becke 1988 (B88) exchange interaction at short-range, and 0.65 {HF} plus 0.35 B88 at long-range.

  abstract   = {Atomization reactions are among the most challenging tests for electronic structure methods. We use the first-principles Weizmann-4 (W4) computational thermochemistry protocol to generate the W4-17 dataset of 200 total atomization energies (TAEs) with 3σ confidence intervals of 1 kJ mol−1. W4-17 is an extension of the earlier W4-11 dataset; it includes first- and second-row molecules and radicals with up to eight non-hydrogen atoms. These cover a broad spectrum of bonding situations and multireference character, and as such are an excellent benchmark for the parameterization and validation of highly accurate ab initio methods (e.g., CCSD(T) composite procedures) and double-hybrid density functional theory (DHDFT) methods. The W4-17 dataset contains two subsets (i) a non-multireference subset of 183 systems characterized by dynamical or moderate nondynamical correlation effects (denoted W4-17-nonMR) and (ii) a highly multireference subset of 17 systems (W4-17-MR). We use these databases to evaluate the performance of a wide range of CCSD(T) composite procedures (e.g., G4, G4(MP2), G4(MP2)-6X, ROG4(MP2)-6X, CBS-QB3, ROCBS-QB3, CBS-APNO, ccCA-PS3, W1, W2, W1-F12, W2-F12, W1X-1, and W2X) and DHDFT methods (e.g., B2-PLYP, B2GP-PLYP, B2K-PLYP, DSD-BLYP, DSD-PBEP86, PWPB95, ωB97X-2(LP), and ωB97X-2(TQZ)). © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract  = {Statistical estimation of the prediction uncertainty of physical models is typically hindered by the inadequacy of these models due to various approximations they are built upon. The prediction errors caused by model inadequacy can be handled either by correcting the model’s results or by adapting the model’s parameter uncertainty to generate prediction uncertainties representative, in a way to be defined, of model inadequacy errors. The main advantage of the latter approach (thereafter called PUI, for Parameter Uncertainty Inflation) is its transferability to the prediction of other quantities of interest based on the same parameters. A critical review of implementations of PUI in several areas of computational chemistry shows that it is biased, in the sense that it does not produce prediction uncertainty bands conforming to model inadequacy errors.},
